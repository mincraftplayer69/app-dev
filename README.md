## Introduction

This series introduces Shinichi Kudo, a high school detective who solves murder cases. While on a date with his childhood friend Ran Mouri, he followed a suspicious man dressed in block in an alleyway. Not knowing that the man had an accomplice he was hit in the back of the head with a bat. He fell to the ground and was forced to drink a pill which the men in black believed to be a poison that can kill Shinichi without any evidence. After the men in black left, Shinichi's body who was a 17-year old high schooler, transformed into a 6-year old elementary schooler with the mind of a 17-year old. 

## Summary

This follows the journey of Shinichi Kudo turned into an elementary schooler named Conan Edogawa, who lives together with his childhood friend Ran Mouri. Conan helps Ran's dad, Kogoro Mouri a private detective, solve cases hoping that it would lead him to the men in black who turned his body into a child and bring them to justice.

> "A detective who uses his deductive powers to corner a suspect, and then does nothing to stop them from committing suicide, is no better than the murderer himself." - *Conan Edogawa*

This is a really good series with unique twits and I highly recommend you watch it!
